0,56,5197,Italy,"Made from 100% Sangiovese, this opens with a lovely floral fragrance of violet and iris. Ripe sour cherry dominates the palate accented by toasted notes and black pepper. Even though it's not complex, the juicy fruit and smooth tannins make this friendly and delicious.",,90,25.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Poggio Scalette 2012  Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Poggio Scalette
1,70,6117,US,"Cherry blossom and wild berries show on the nose of this appellation blend by a longtime boutique producer, who flies far under the radar even within the region. The palate shows plum skin, tart dark berry and barely ripe red-currant flavors, along with ground espresso, juniper and sandalwood.",,92,75.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Wedell Cellars 2011 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Pinot Noir,Wedell Cellars
2,114,11681,Germany,"Auxerrois, a grape variety rarely seen in the United States, shows it's fresh white grapefruit and pear flavors well in this brisk, revitalizing wine. Dry in style, it's a zesty, straightforward wine intended for early consumption.",Nitteler Rochusfels Trocken,87,16.0,Mosel,,,Anna Lee C. Iijima,,Frieden-Berg 2013 Nitteler Rochusfels Trocken Auxerrois (Mosel),Auxerrois,Frieden-Berg
3,128,13017,US,"Smells thin and sweaty-funky, with little flavor, except the heat of alcohol. Maybe there's a drop of cherries.",,81,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,Russian Hill 2005 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Russian Hill
4,250,24574,Australia,"Pike's top Riesling features aromas of crushed stone and damp moss, while the flavors bring to mind tangy limes and underripe nectarines. It's actually a bit rounder in feel than expected, then gains focus on the long finish.",The Merle,91,40.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Pikes 2014 The Merle Riesling (Clare Valley),Riesling,Pikes
5,291,27814,US,"From older vines planted on the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine is thickly concentrated, with a generosity of oak.

6,408,39959,US,"Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter. The wine has nice weight and texture, so if you don't mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking.",Estate Bottled,80,19.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Macari 1997 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),Cabernet Franc,Macari
7,412,40741,US,"Summers has been quietly perfecting Cabernet under the radar. The '04 continues a string of successful vintages. It's riper and more accessible than previous years, and rewards for expressive black currant flavors enhanced with lots of fine, smoky new oak. The tannins are so gentle, you can drink this wine now, but it should hold for a good six years.",,91,46.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Summers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Summers
8,430,42445,Portugal,"Lush, ripe wine, full of black fruits and a generous texture. The wine is soft, just a hint of dryness to give it weight and density. Berry fruits, black plums and acidity promise some aging.  Drink from 2014.",Monsaraz,88,12.0,Alentejo,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz 2012 Monsaraz Red (Alentejo),Portuguese Red,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz
9,460,44802,US,"Aged both in French oak and stainless steel, this entry-level white is creamy in texture with a taste of lemon cream pie and vanilla swirls, the tannins tight and the oak present, though cradling. Fresh and fruity, this is a food-friendly, approachable wine.",,88,23.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Artesa 2014 Chardonnay (Carneros),Chardonnay,Artesa
10,462,44891,Spain,"Bold yellow-gold in color, this aged, barrel-fermented Verdejo has predictably heavy aromas of wood spice and resin, joined by hints of carrot juice and apricot.

11,508,49736,US,"Io has a really good track record with this Syrah, which is grown in Paso Robles. The '06 is intricately structured, a dry wine with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, dates, mocha, leather, grilled meat, pepper and vanilla. Hard to resist drinking it now, but it should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.",Ryan Road Vineyard,92,48.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,,,Io 2006 Ryan Road Vineyard Syrah (San Luis Obispo County),Syrah,Io

Iijima,,Glenora 2010 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Riesling,Glenora
13,574,56157,Spain,"Berry and plum aromas are so ripe that raisin enters the picture. This feels medium to full, with soft acidity. Flavors of chocolate and wood spice share space with ripe berry fruit, while a full, long finish deals mocha and raisin notes.",Faustino V Reserva,89,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Bodegas Faustino 2011 Faustino V Reserva  (Rioja),Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
14,623,61186,Italy,"Underbrush, scorched earth, menthol and plum steeped in spirits are some of the aromas that unfold on the glass. The big, chewy palate doles out ripe wild cherry, raspberry jam, ground pepper and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish.",Vigna Piaggia,90,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Abbadia Ardenga 2011 Vigna Piaggia  (Brunello di Montalcino),Sangiovese,Abbadia Ardenga
15,660,64674,Spain,"An oddball blend of many grapes that offers a spicy oak cover and sweet, earthy notes from front to back. But it's hard as nails, with blazing acidity, the result of which is a clacky, rough wine. On the plus side it has interesting flavors with tobacco and citrus notes.",5 Finca Reserva,83,19.0,Northern Spain,Empordà,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Castillo de Perelada 2005 5 Finca Reserva Red (Empordà),Red Blend,Castillo de Perelada

18,1061,104009,Italy,"From Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and his family (vintners in Tuscany for 130 years) comes this bright, cheerful sparkler. It shows crisp acidity, ease, tonic effervescence and overall harmony.",,86,19.0,Veneto,Prosecco,,,,Bocelli NV  Prosecco,Glera,Bocelli
19,1115,109564,France,"Dry and tannic, this totally structured wine has weight. However the fruit element has vanished leaving a dense wine, very firm and just given brightness by acidity.

20,1313,129637,France,"This is a powerhouse of ripe fruits, strong tannins and dark acidity. It burst out of the glass with its bold, firm flavors and solid structure. It is already balanced, the fruit complementing the dense texture. But it will certainly develop more and age very well.
